# task-board
A simple React taskboard application that allows users to add tasks, edit them or tag as completed. It is an ongoing project.
## TODO
- Add modal-based view to adding and editing tasks
- Add user authentication and deploy the app
- Add tags - labels that allow users to group their tasks by a different category, like 'Urgent', 'Study', 'Work', etc.
- Add the ability to create custom taskboards with tables using tags
